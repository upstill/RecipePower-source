Welcome to RecipePower, <%= response_service.user.handle %>! You are now a 
member in good standing of the RecipePower community, all 
signed in and everything. Your collection awaits you 
at www.recipepower.com.

Right now, your settings go like this:
  Username: <%= response_service.user.username %>
  Polite name: <%= response_service.user.polite_name %>
  Email: <%= response_service.user.email %>
  Password: unless you've changed it, same as your email.

If any of this (especially the password) doesn't suit, you can get to
your Profile on the menu under your name.

<% if @inviter %>
Since <%= @inviter.handle %> invited you, you are Friends by 
default, so you will find their collection at "<%= @inviter.handle %>" 
when you choose the "My Friends" label. If this doesn't suit, 
just click the 'X' next to their name and they're no longer 
your friend. Sad but true.

<% end %>

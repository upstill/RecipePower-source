Welcome to RecipePower, <%= @invitee.handle %>! You are now a 
member in good standing of the RecipePower community, all 
signed in and everything. Your collection awaits you 
at www.recipepower.com.

Right now, your settings go like this:
  Username: <%= @invitee.username %>
  Polite name: <%= @invitee.polite_name %>
  Email: <%= @invitee.email %>
  Password: unless you've changed it, same as your email.

If any of this (especially the password) doesn't suit, you can get to
your Profile on the menu under your name.

<% if @inviter %>
Since <%= @inviter.handle %> invited you, you are Friends by 
default, so you will find their collection at "<%= @inviter.handle %>" 
when you choose the "My Friends" label. If this doesn't suit, 
just click the 'X' next to their name and they're no longer 
your friend. Sad but true.

<% end %>
We've worked hard to keep RecipePower simple, but if you 
get confused, hit the Help link at the bottom left of the page.

Just one more thing: we're always keen to hear what you 
have to say, especially if something's bugging you. Click 
the red Feedback tab at left and tell us how it's going. 
Response Guaranteed!

We're glad you've joined us, <%= @invitee.handle %>. Happy Eating!

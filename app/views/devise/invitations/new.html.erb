I can't promise to implement every suggestion, but I CAN promise to take very seriously your experience of the site. I really want to make something people love to use. 2) If you go out to the Web and cookmark 10 or 12 of your favorite recipes, that will not only get you over the hump to using the site, but it'll be a HUGE help for us in getting our content levered up. ...but thanks for whatever you have time to do.".html_safe %>

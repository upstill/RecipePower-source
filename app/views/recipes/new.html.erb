	      <li>Copy its address from the source site. (Viewing the recipe page, select the contents of the browser's address bar and do Edit:Copy.)</li>

	<strong>PS</strong> You don't <strong>have</strong> 
	to copy and paste URLs to capture recipes.
	Instead, click and drag this handy widget into your browser's
	bookmarks bar. Then, whenever you see a recipe you like on 
	the Web, just click the "Cookmark" button and that page will be 
	whisked off to your collection.

<h3>Tagging Recipes</h3>
<p>Tags are not just descriptions. They help people find what they're looking for. Think about who should see the
recipes that you've posted. People interested in healthy eating? Vegetarian recipes? Italian food? Those areas are
fairly well covered, but maybe you have an area you're interested in. Baking? South American food? Tagging your
collection will not only help <i>you</i> get back to them, it'll help other people navigate in useful ways.</p>

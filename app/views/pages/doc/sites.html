<h3>How to Edit and Approve Sites</h3>
<p>
    tl;dr:
    <li>First thing is to confirm that the site exists by following its link. Sites should be deleted if the link is
dead, OR it leads to a domain parker, OR it's obviously unsuitable.</li>
<li>As a rule, sites should be marked Visible if they include recipes, but not otherwise. All other sites should be Hidden.</li>
<li><b>If a site is Visible, it should have a Picture/Logo.</b></li>
    <li>The Home URL is the external link where people will be taken upon clicking. It's usually fine
    unless there's a specific food-related subsite (CNN, NYTimes, etc.). Think about where YOU would like to be sent.</li>
    <li>The Path URL is what's used to match recipes, etc., to their sites. Useful only when there are distinct
    subsites on a single domain.</li>
<li>Tags on a site are for browsing, so it's not essential that a tag apply to everything you might find there. If
you tag a site for Healthy Recipes (b/c that's its theme), nobody will sue if they find a few unhealthy ones. Again, if
it's appropriate for a person to be led to the site by following a tag, go for it.</li>
<li>The Picture (Logo) field is hard to glean automatically. You may have to copy and paste the image from the site page,
or even using something like the Grab app to capture the pixels directly. Everything except SVG elements is supported for
pasting into the Picture.</li>
    </ul>

    Start by going into Admin mode. If you're not an admin, contact Steve. Once in Admin mode, there'll be
    a choice on the menu under your name for "Review Pending Sites".
</p>
<p>
    Here are all the sites that haven't been examined. That's your workspace. For each site, the goal is to declare it
    Visible or Hidden. "Visible" just means that it's seen in casual browsing, i.e., it'll show up in this list when
    users go looking/browsing for interesting sites. So a site should only be Visible if it has recipes. All other sites
    should be Hidden.
</p>
<p>
    So why do we have sites that are hidden at all? Because whenever a link is saved, it gets associated with a site. So
    if a chef has a vanity page, it has a site. If there's a Definition page for some ingredient, that page will have a
    site.
</p>
<p>
    Bottom line: simple rule: if it's a site you'd like to see in the
</p>
<h4>Site Home (Title & Description tab)</h4>
<p>
    The site's Home URL is where the user lands when they follow the site's external link. When a site gets built, this
    will just be a domain (nothing after the 'http://whatever.com'). This is usually correct. But if there's a food section
    of a larger site like Today.com or the New York Times, you don't necessarily want to send a user to the general site.
    In that case, locate the home of the subsite and revise this link.

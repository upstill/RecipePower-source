  <h2 class="med">RecipePower:<br>Where Inspiration Meets Opportunity</h2>
  <p class="airy">
    Between discovering a great recipe and actually <strong>remembering</strong> it when the time comes is a wide gulf.
    But RecipePower is here to help: to bring your inspired choices back into mind at just the right moment. How does it
    work? When your wanderings bring you to a recipe that's just perfect for you (but not now), click the Cookmark
    button and it will be waiting for you in RecipePower. Give it some Hints as to when you'd like to see it again
    (maybe it's a great way to use fresh tomatoes, or something you want to bring out next Thanksgiving or...). Then,
    when those tomatoes show up, or Fall rolls around, RecipePower leads you right back to them, just like that.
